                The Tech Fair is an annual event that brings together innovative student minds to showcase groundbreaking technology projects.
                This platform is designed to help judges fairly evaluate each project based on creativity, impact, and technical implementation.
                Scores are submitted in real-time, and a public scoreboard displays the latest rankings.
